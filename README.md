Comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction models enable identifying and targeting women at high-risk, while reducing interventions in those at low-risk.
Breast cancer risk prediction models used in clinical practice have low discriminatory accuracy (0.53â€“0.64). 
Machine learning (ML) offers an alternative approach to standard prediction modeling that may address current limitations and improve accuracy of those tools. 
The purpose of this study was to compare the discriminatory accuracy of ML-based estimates against a pair of established methods. In this we have used logistic regression 
and Decesion tree algo in our first version and Random forest  in our version 2. and we found that logistic regression gives the best accuracy.
